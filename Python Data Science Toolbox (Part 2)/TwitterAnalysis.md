# Processing large amounts of Twitter data

Sometimes, the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. This is a common problem faced by data scientists. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once. 

**For Reference: If you are interested in learning how to access Twitter data so you can work with it on your own system, refer to Part 2 of the DataCamp course on Importing Data in Python.**

## Processing large amounts of Twitter data

```
# Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
counts_dict = {}

# Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
for chunk in pd.read_csv('tweets.csv', chunksize = 10):

    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in chunk['lang']:
        if entry in counts_dict.keys():
            counts_dict[entry] += 1
        else:
            counts_dict[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(counts_dict)

```

## Extracting information for large amounts of Twitter data

Great job chunking out that file in the previous exercise. You now know how to deal with situations where you need to process a very large file and that's a very useful skill to have!

It's good to know how to process a file in smaller, more manageable chunks, but it can become very tedious having to write and rewrite the same code for the same task each time. In this exercise, you will be making your code more reusable by putting your work in the last exercise in a function definition.
The pandas package has been imported as pd and the file 'tweets.csv' is in your current directory for your use.

```
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(csv_file, c_size, colname):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary: counts_dict
    counts_dict = {}

    # Iterate over the file chunk by chunk
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(csv_file, chunksize=c_size):

        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in chunk[colname]:
            if entry in counts_dict.keys():
                counts_dict[entry] += 1
            else:
                counts_dict[entry] = 1

    # Return counts_dict
    return counts_dict

# Call count_entries(): result_counts
result_counts = count_entries('tweets.csv', 10, 'lang')

# Print result_counts
print(result_counts)

```

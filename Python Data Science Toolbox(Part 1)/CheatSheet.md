# Functions
```
Function Header
    """Doc Strings immediate after the header"""
    Function Body(intended)
    return statement
```

example:
```
# Define shout with the parameter, word
def shout(word):
    """Return a string with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate the strings: shout_word
    shout_word = word + '!!!'

    # Replace print with return
    return shout_word

# Pass 'congratulations' to shout: yell
yell = shout('congratulations')

# Print yell
print(yell)

```

## Return multiple values

> Make return type Tuple
 
1. In tuples we can't modify values
2. Make with ()
3. even_nums = (2,4,6)
   Unpack tuples  a,b,c = even_nums
4. Accessing same as list

Example:
```
# Define shout_all with parameters word1 and word2
def shout_all(word1, word2):
    
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Construct a tuple with shout1 and shout2: shout_words
    shout_words = (shout1, shout2)

    # Return shout_words
    return shout_words

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout_all(): yell1, yell2
yell1, yell2 = shout_all('congratulations', 'you')

# Print yell1 and yell2
print(yell1)
print(yell2)
```
>You've learned how to add parameters to your own function definitions, return a value or multiple values with tuples, and how to call the functions you've defined.

## Applications: Tweet count for programming languages

In this and the following exercise, you will bring together all these concepts and apply them to a simple data science problem. You will load a dataset and develop functionalities to extract simple insights from the data.

For this exercise, your goal is to recall how to load a dataset into a DataFrame. The dataset contains Twitter data and you will iterate over entries in a column to build a dictionary in which the keys are the names of languages and the values are the number of tweets in the given language. The file tweets.csv is available in your current directory.

```
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Import Twitter data as DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv("tweets.csv")

# Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
langs_count = {}

# Extract column from DataFrame: col
col = df['lang']

# Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
for entry in col:

    # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
    if entry in langs_count.keys():
        langs_count[entry]+=1
    # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
    else:
        langs_count[entry] = 1

# Print the populated dictionary
print(langs_count)
```

```
# Define count_entries()
def count_enteries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry]+= 1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count

# Call count_entries(): result
result = count_enteries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)
```

## Scope: LEGB Rule
1. Local
2. Enclosing Functions
3. Global
4. Built-in scope

```
# Create a string: team
team = "teen titans"

# Define change_team()
def change_team():
    """Change the value of the global variable team."""

    # Use team in global scope
    global team

    # Change the value of team in global: team
    team = "justice league"
# Print team
print(team)

# Call change_team()
change_team()

# Print team
print(team)
```
Python's built-in scope, which is really just a built-in module called builtins. However, to query builtins, you'll need to import builtins

```
import builtins
'array' nit in dir(builtins)
```

## Nested functions:

```
# Define three_shouts
def three_shouts(word1, word2, word3):
    """Returns a tuple of strings
    concatenated with '!!!'."""

    # Define inner
    def inner(word):
        """Returns a string concatenated with '!!!'."""
        return word + '!!!'

    # Return a tuple of strings
    return (inner(word1), inner(word2),inner(word3))

# Call three_shouts() and print
print(three_shouts('a', 'b', 'c'))
```

### Returning Functions
```
# Define echo
def echo(n):
    """Return the inner_echo function."""

    # Define inner_echo
    def inner_echo(word1):
        """Concatenate n copies of word1."""
        echo_word = word1 * n
        return echo_word

    # Return inner_echo
    return inner_echo

# Call echo: twice
twice = echo(2)

# Call echo: thrice
thrice = echo(3)

# Call twice() and thrice() then print
print(twice('hello'), thrice('hello'))
```

```
# Define echo_shout()
def echo_shout(word):
    """Change the value of a nonlocal variable"""
    
    # Concatenate word with itself: echo_word
    echo_word = word*2
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)
    
    # Define inner function shout()
    def shout():
        """Alter a variable in the enclosing scope"""    
        # Use echo_word in nonlocal scope
        nonlocal echo_word
        
        # Change echo_word to echo_word concatenated with '!!!'
        echo_word = echo_word + '!!!'
    
    # Call function shout()
    shout()
    
    # Print echo_word
    print(echo_word)

# Call function echo_shout() with argument 'hello'
echo_shout('hello')
```

## Default | Flexible | Flexible keyword Arguments

```
# Define shout_echo
def shout_echo(word1, echo=1, intense = False):
    """Concatenate echo copies of word1 and three
    exclamation marks at the end of the string."""

    echo_word = word1 * echo

    # Capitalize echo_word if intense is True
    if intense is True:
        # Capitalize and concatenate '!!!': echo_word_new
        echo_word_new = echo_word.upper() + '!!!'
    else:
        # Concatenate '!!!' to echo_word: echo_word_new
        echo_word_new = echo_word + '!!!'

    # Return echo_word_new
    return echo_word_new

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey", echo=5 and intense=True: with_big_echo
with_big_echo = shout_echo("Hey", echo=5, intense=True)

# Call shout_echo() with "Hey" and intense=True: big_no_echo
big_no_echo = shout_echo("Hey", intense=True)

# Print values
print(with_big_echo)
print(big_no_echo)

        print(key + ": " + value)

    print("\nEND REPORT")

# First call to report_status()

# Second call to report_status()
report_status(name="anakin", affiliation="sith lord", status="deceased")
```

## Applications: Tweet count for programming languages

we will generalize the Twitter language analysis that you did in the previous chapter. You will do that by including a default argument that takes a column name.

For your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.

```
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name = 'lang'):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}

    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
        if entry in cols_count.keys():
            cols_count[entry] += 1

        # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            cols_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the cols_count dictionary
    return cols_count

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Call count_entries(): result2
result2 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'source')

# Print result1 and result2
print(result1)
print(result2)
```

### Output:
```
{'et': 1, 'und': 2, 'en': 97}
    {'<a href="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">Google</a>': 2, '<a href="http://linkis.com" rel="nofollow">Linkis.com</a>': 2, '<a href="http://twitter.com/download/iphone" rel="nofollow">Twitter for iPhone</a>': 33, '<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/download/ipad" rel="nofollow">Twitter for iPad</a>': 6, '<a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=93" rel="nofollow">newzlasz</a>': 2, '<a href="http://www.facebook.com/twitter" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a>': 1, '<a href="http://www.twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter for BlackBerry</a>': 2, '<a href="http://www.myplume.com/" rel="nofollow">Plume\xa0for\xa0Android</a>': 1, '<a href="http://twitter.com/download/android" rel="nofollow">Twitter for Android</a>': 26, '<a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter Web Client</a>': 24, '<a href="http://ifttt.com" rel="nofollow">IFTTT</a>': 1}

## Bringing it all together

Wow, you've just generalized your Twitter language analysis that you did in the previous chapter to include a default argument for the column name. You're now going to generalize this function one step further by allowing the user to pass it a flexible argument, that is, in this case, as many column names as the user would like!

Once again, for your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.

```
# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, *args):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of
    occurrences as value for each key."""
    
    #Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
    cols_count = {}
    
    # Iterate over column names in args
    for col_name in args:
    
        # Extract column from DataFrame: col
        col = df[col_name]
    
        # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
        for entry in col:
    
            # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
            if entry in cols_count.keys():
                cols_count[entry] += 1
    
            # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
            else:
                cols_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the cols_count dictionary
    return cols_count

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Call count_entries(): result2
result2 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang', 'source')

# Print result1 and result2
print(result1)
print(result2)
```
